We are a group of [CNRS](http://www.cnrs.fr/index.php) and [EPHE](https://www.ephe.fr/) researchers working at [CEFE](http://www.cefe.cnrs.fr/fr/) at the interface of ecology, modelling and social sciences. HAIR is for Human-Animal InteRactions :smile: In particular, we investigate:

* Management of exploited and/or protected animal populations
* Interactions between humans and animals and socio-ecological systems
* Transfer of knowledge (courses, workshops)
